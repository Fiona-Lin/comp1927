Question: the assn2Bonus spec says 
"warn the thief about a detective's location if a detective comes 
within N cities of the thief", N here refers to 
distance/weight and not vertex indices, right?
<P>
Answer: It does not mean the distance (weight) or the vertex indices. 
It means if there are N cities between them eg if a 
detective is in city 3 and the thief is in 
city 10 and the detective could get to city 10 by going from 
3 to 1 then 6 then 10 then the detective is 3 cities away. 
It does not matter how big the weights are. 
It is how many cities the detective would have to travel through to 
get to the thief.

<P><H2>Assignment 2 Bonus Challenge Tasks </H2></p>
<OL>
<LI><STRONG>Task 0: Makefile - 0 Marks (but mandatory - you will receive 0 
for automarking if it is missing) </STRONG>
<P>Complete a Makefile for the bonus component of the assignment. 
<P>It should be capable of producing:
<p>
<TABLE border = '1' cellspacing = '0' cellpadding = '6' >
<TR><TD><STRONG>File name</STRONG><TD><STRONG>Comment</STRONG></TR>
<TR><TD>assn2Bonus<TD>Client program</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>We will be using your makefile to compile your assignment for 
automarking, so if you do not provide one you will receive 0 for the automarking. Also make sure your Makefile produces executables with the same name as given above. eg assn2Bonus

<LI><STRONG>Task 1: Thief Strategy Implementation - 2 Marks</STRONG>
<P>
You must modify the assn2 program and implement a strategy for the thief.
<P>Assume the thief has a map of the cities and knows where the getaway location is. Also assume that the thief knows the location of each detective, but does not know the strategy or stamina of the agent. Also assume that for this part of the assignment no detectives will be using random strategy. The thief does not know where the informants for the detectives are. 

<P>The aim is to implement a clever strategy for the thief that increases the liklihood of getting away, or at least holding off being caught for as long as possible.

</P>
<li> <b>Diary: 0 Marks (but you lose 1 mark if it is missing)</b>You 
must maintain an assn2Diary.txt file. 
You will need to provide an entry in an assn2BonusDiary to explain 
your
strategy and the basics of how it works.

</OL>


<H2>Assessment of assn2Bonus </h2>
<P>
This will be run as a competition. 
<P>
All entries, along with the original random thief from the assn2Model will 
be 
run in different situations.
<P>Different situations will include different maps, different starting locations, 
different seeds, 
different detective strategies etc.

<P>Any submissions that do not follow the rules of the game will be disqualified. If they seem like a serious attempt that unintentionally broke the rules, they will get 0.5 marks, but will not be run during the competition.
<P>
During the competition, the number of times the thief gets away will be 
recorded. The number of times the thief is caught will also be recorded, 
along with as the number of hours the thief can resist being 
caught by the detectives in situations when the thief gets caught or time 
runs out..
<P>The score is calculated by the number of getaways minus the number of 
times the thief is caught.
<P>The person with the highest score wins. In cases of ties, the total 
number of hours the thief resisted being caught will be taken into account.
<P>
<STRONG> Marks </STRONG>
<P>Marks will be given as follows:
<OL>
<LI>Winner 2/2
<LI>Second 1.9/2
<LI>Third  1.8/2

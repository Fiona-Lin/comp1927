<H2>Exercise 1</H2>
<STRONG>Graph Properties</STRONG>

<p>
In the 18th Century, the Prussian town of Konigsberg (now Kaliningrad)
was famous for the seven bridges connecting its two central islands
with the banks of the River Pregel, as shown in the diagram.
</p>
<center><img src="./bridges.png"></center>
<ol type='a'>
<li> Can you draw a path which crosses each bridge exactly once?
<li> If not, which bridge would you need to remove* to ensure that you could draw such a path?
<li> For each case, show the path.
</ol>
<p><small>
(* Possible methods of "removal" include: blowing up,
weighing down with love-locks until it collapses,
blocking permanently with Sydney Buses, etc.)
</small></p>
<STRONG>Answer:</STRONG>
<p>
It helps to have an annotated version of the bridges map.
In the version below, the regions of land are the vertices
and the bridges are the edges. There are only four vertices
(A = north bank, B = small island, C = large island, D = south bank).
Note also that this graph allows multiple edges between two vertices.
We label these, so as to be able to distinguish the bridges
</p>
<center><img src="./bridge-graph.png"></center>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>
No you can't ... but try a few first just to see.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Removing bridge 1 allows starting from C and crossing bridges 3,2,4,7,5,6.<br>
Removing bridge 2 allows starting from C and crossing bridges 3,1,4,7,5,6.<br>
Removing bridge 3 allows starting from B and crossing bridged 1,2,4,7,5,6.<br>
Removing bridge 4 allows starting from A and crossing bridges 1,2,3,7,5,6.<br>
Removing bridge 5 allows starting from C and crossing bridges 4,6,7,3,2,1.<br>
Removing bridge 6 allows starting from A and crossing bridges 4,5,7,3,2,1.<br>
Removing bridge 7 allows starting from A and crossing bridges 1,2,3,4,5,6.<br>
In fact, removing any one bridge allows you to solve the problem.
</p></li>
<li><p>
See previous answer, which gives one path for each case.
Other paths also exist.
</p></li>
<p>
This, of course, is an instance of the Euler Path problem.

In what order would you visit the nodes if you started at vertex 0
and used the cheapest least visited approach from assn2 and you had
stamina of 100000? (Show the first 10 vertices you would visit in the
order you would travel to them).

What about if you had a stamina level of 50?

<IMG src="./digraph1.png"> </IMG>
<P>What order would the nodes be visited while performing a depth first search 
 starting at node <i>d</i>. What about if we started at node <i>g</i>?
<STRONG>Answer:</STRONG>

<PRE>
If we called dfsR with starting node <i>d</i> we would get
d b a c g f
We would have to call dfsR again starting at node <i>e</i> to get all nodes in graph. 
So overall:
d b a c g f e

If we called dfsR with starting node g we would get node <i>g</i>
We would have to call dfsR again, starting at say node <i>a</i>, then again starting at node e to visit all nodes
So overall:
g a d b c f e
</PRE>

<p>Directed Graph BFS</p>
<p>What order would the nodes be visited while performing a breadth first search starting at node <i>d</i>. What about if we started at node <i>g</i>?

<PRE>
If we called bfs with starting node <i>d</i> we would get
d b f g a c
We would then have to call bfs with starting node <i>e</i>
So overall:
d b f g a c e

If we called bfs with starting node <i>g</i> we would get g
We would have to call bfs again, starting at say node <i>a</i>, then again starting at node e to visit all nodes
So overall:
g a d b f c e

<H2>Exercise 5: Additional questions - Do at home</H2>
<p>
<STRONG>Adjcency Matrix</STRONG>

The standard adjacency matrix representation for a graph uses a full <i>V&times;V</i> matrix and stores each edge twice (at [v,w]
and [w,v]). This consumes a lot of space, and wastes a lot of space when the graph is sparse. One simple way to improve the space
usage would be to define the matrix elements as <tt>bool</tt> rather than <tt>int</tt>, e.g.
</p>
<pre>
int **edges; // matrix of booleans (0 or 1)
<span class="comment">... becomes ...</span>
bool **edges; // matrix of booleans (0 or 1)
<span class="comment">... where bool is defined as ... </span>
typedef unsigned char bool;
</pre>
<p>
We could use even less space by storing just the upper (or lower) triangular part of the matrix, as shown in the diagram below:
</p>
<center><img src="./adj-matrix.png"></center>
<p>
The <i>V&times;V</i> matrix has been replaced by a single array containing just the "useful" parts of the matrix.
This gives a new <tt>Graph</tt> representation:
</p>

<pre>
// Upper-triangluar adjacency matrix graph representation

struct graphRep {
    int   nV;     // #vertices
    int   nE;     // #edges
    bool *edges;  // array of booleans (0 or 1)
};

</pre>
<p>
Accessing the elements is no longer as simple as <tt>edges[v][w]</tt>.  Write a function that takes two vertices from an edge and determines
the corresponding index in the <tt>edges</tt> array which holds the boolean value for this edge.
Use the following function template:
</p>
<pre>
int indexOf(Vertex v, Vertex w)
{
    assert(v != w); <span class="comment">// no self-edges</span>
    if (v &gt; w) { Vertex tmp = v; v = w; v = tmp; }
    ...
}

<STRONG>Answer:</STRONG>
int indexOf(Vertex v, Vertex w)
{
    assert(v != w); // no self-edges
    if (v > w) { Vertex tmp = v; v = w; v = tmp; }
    assert(w > v);  // redundant
    int i;  // counts the number of iterations
    int j;  // gives the increment for eah iteration
    int k;  // accumulates the index value
    for (i = 0, j = nV-1, k = 0; i < v; i++, j--) {
        k += j;
    }
    k += w-1;
    return k;
}
</pre>

<p>
The standard implementation of the adjacency list representation
for graphs stores each edge twice.  The edge <i>(v,w)</i> appears as a <i>w</i> stored in the
adjacency list for <i>v</i> and as a <i>v</i> stored in the adjacency list for <i>w</i>.
A more storage efficient representation (analgous to storing just the top-right half of the adjacency matrix), would be
store information for each edge just once. 
</p>
<p>
Re-implement the following functions from lectures to use this each-edge-stored-once variation of adjacency lists:
</p>
<pre>
void insertE(Graph g, Edge e);
void removeE(Graph g, Edge e);
int neighbours(Graph g, Vertex x, Vertex y);
</pre>
<p>
You should <em>not</em> assume that supplied <tt>Edge</tt> values will necessarily satisfy <tt>(e.v &lt; e.w)</tt>.  Assume the code for adjacency List
given to you in the lectures and that functions <tt>insertVList</tt>, <tt>deleteVList</tt>, <tt>searchVList</tt> to add,delete and add an edge to a list exist.
</p>
<STRONG>Answer:</STRONG>
<p>
The following functions support the each-edge-stored-once variation of adjacency lists:
</p>
<pre class="c" style="font-family:monospace;">
Edge normalise(Edge e)
{
    if (e.v > e.w) {
        Vertex tmp = e.v; e.v = e.w; e.w = tmp; 
    }
    return e;
}

void insertE(Graph g, Edge e)
{
    assert(g != NULL);
    assert(validV(g,e.v) && validV(g,e.w));
    e = normalise(e);
    int orig = length(g->edges[e.v]);
	 g->edges[e.v] = insertVList(e.w,g->edges[e.v]);
	 if (length(g->edges[e.v]) > orig) g->nE++;
	 
}

void removeE(Graph g, Edge e)
{
    assert(g != NULL);
    assert(validV(g,e.v) && validV(g,e.w));
    e = normalise(e);
    g->edges[e.v] = deleteVList(g->edges[e.v], e.w);
    if (length(g->edges[e.v]) < orig) g->nE--;
}

int neighbours(Graph e, Vertex v, Vertex w)
{
    if (v > w) { Vertex t = v; v = w; w = t; }
    return searchVList(g->edges[v], w);
}
